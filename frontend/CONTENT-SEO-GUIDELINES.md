## 🎯 Keyword Strategy

### Target Keyword Placement

**Primary Keywords (Use 3-5 times per page):**

- Naturally throughout content

**Secondary Keywords (Use 2-3 times):**
- Subheadings
- Body paragraphs

- Link anchor text

**LSI Keywords (Latent Semantic Indexing):**
Include related terms naturally:
- Primary: "food systems expert"
- LSI: "food security," "sustainable agriculture," "nutrition science"

### Example - Good vs Bad

❌ **Bad (Keyword Stuffing):**
> "As a food systems expert, I provide food systems consulting. My food systems expertise helps organizations with food systems transformation."

✅ **Good (Natural Integration):**
